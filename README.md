yii2-binpacking2d
============

Implementation of BinPacking (2D) in PHP. This is ideal for generating spritesheets, etc. If you are looking for 2D/3D packing for cargo loading then you are looking for a far more extended version of this implementation.

Things that would be nice to implement
--------------------------------------
* Try to merge the nodes with neighboring nodes to create bigger rectangles. This will result in even tighter and better distribution.
